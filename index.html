              JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is a core technology
              of the World Wide Web. It allows for dynamic, client-side scripting in web browsers,
              enabling interactive web pages and user interfaces. JavaScript supports
              object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

              The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface built for HTML and XML
              documents. It represents the page that allows programs and scripts to dynamically
              update the document structure, content, and style.

              Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle projects of any size
              with speed and efficiency. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git tracks changes in
              source code during software development, allowing multiple developers to work together
              on non-linear development. It provides strong support for branching, merging, and
              distributed development workflows.

              CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the presentation
              of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements should be displayed on
              screen, on paper, or in other media. CSS separates the design from the content,
              allowing for greater flexibility and control over the layout, colors, and fonts of web
              pages.

              React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for
              single-page applications. Developed and maintained by Facebook, it allows developers
              to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render as data changes.
              React uses a virtual DOM for performance optimization and supports a unidirectional
              data flow. Its component-based architecture promotes modularity and reusability.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests in web
              browsers. It provides a more powerful and flexible way to send and receive data
              compared to older methods like XMLHttpRequest. Fetch uses Promises, allowing for
              cleaner asynchronous code.
